VoteChain is a decentralized voting application built as a hackathon project at Pillai College of Engineering, Panvel. It uses React for the frontend, Express/Node.js for the backend API, Solidity smart contracts for on-chain voting logic, and MetaMask for user authentication and transaction signing. The goal is to provide a transparent, tamper-resistant voting experience suitable for small to medium voting scenarios (college elections, clubs, hackathon polls).

ðŸš€ Project Description
VoteChain enables voters to connect with MetaMask, view active elections, register as voters (if required), and cast votes that are recorded on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain. Votes are processed by a Solidity smart contract to ensure immutability and transparency. A minimal backend (Express) stores off-chain metadata and helps with indexing, while the React frontend provides a clean UI for voters and admins.

This project was developed during a hackathon at Pillai College of Engineering, Panvel.
